Subject: Advanced Regression Models with R Applications

Hello SoCal RUG:

This is a reminder that on October 1, we will have a workshop on advanced regression techniques. Currently, half of the tickets have been sold, so if you are thinking of going you may want to act now. Dr. Olga gave this course a couple of years ago and it was a HUGE success it is looking like it will be a success this year too. The sign-up is on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-advanced-regression-models-with-r-applications-tickets-407225381077). 

In this workshop, we will talk about a variety of regression models, give their definitions, discuss goodness-of-fit criteria, present fitted models, interpret estimated regression coefficients, and use the fitted models for prediction. The models will be limited to linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyze data and interpret results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [“Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L1B143S/), CRC Press, 2018.
