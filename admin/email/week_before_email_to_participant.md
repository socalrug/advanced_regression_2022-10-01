# SoCal RUG 2022 Regression Course Preparation

## Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression/blob/master/README.md) file for the event.
1. SoCal RUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [SoCal RUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. 
    1. If you are not on the [SoCal Slack channel](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack) please [sign-up](https://tinyurl.com/socalrug-slack-signup). 
    1. Join the **regression-2022** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the course.
1. Information for the event is kept in the [advanced_regression](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*. The following section will help you do that.
    1. You will need *git* installed. In Windows it referred to as **GitBash**. For instructions on doing installing it in Windows, we have created a [guide](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01/blob/master/setup/git%20for%20Windows/git%20for%20Windows.pdf) or you can use this [tutorial](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/git/how-to-install-git-windows-10-operating-system.html). On Windows 10 you can also install it in the Ubuntu console. For the Mac, [download the installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
    1. Clone the event repo. Go to a command line terminal (Linux/Mac) or *GitBash* in Windows. Use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression.git
```
1. Run the [check_setup.r](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01/blob/master/check_setup.r) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. **This can take quite a while to run**.

## Other Details

1. The event will be held at the Paul Merage School of Business at UC Irvine in building SB1. See the [parking instructions](https://github.com/socalrug/advanced_regression_2022-10-01/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) and how to locate SB1.
1. Registration will be between 8:30 and 9:00 on Saturday, Oct 1st. The event will start at 9:00.

Looking forward to seeing everyone there.
