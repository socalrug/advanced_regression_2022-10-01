Subject: Advanced regression course

Hello:

[SoCal R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/SOCAL-RUG/) is Southern California's premier data science meetup group. They holding an event that is sure to be a great educational event.

On October 1, they will have a workshop on advanced regression techniques. Dr. Olga gave this course a couple of years ago and it was a HUGE success. The sign-up is on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/socal-rug-advanced-regression-models-with-r-applications-tickets-407225381077). 

In this workshop, you will learn a variety of regression models. We will give their definitions, discuss goodness-of-fit criteria, present fitted models, interpret estimated regression coefficients, and use the fitted models for prediction. The models will be limited to linear regression, Box-Cox transformation, gamma regression, ordinary logistic regression, Poisson regression, beta regression, longitudinal (repeated measures) regression, and hierarchical model.

The workshop is designed to be hands-on. Participants are required to bring laptops and be ready to write R, analyze data and interpret results. For each model, we present an example with a complete R code, and then will an exercise to work on. Workshop participants should be familiar with algebraic expressions of different probability distributions and have a fundamental knowledge of simple linear regression: normally distributed random error, continuous and categorical independent variables (requiring creating dummy variables).

The material covered by the workshop will be taken from my recently published book [“Advanced Regression Models with SAS and R Applications”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L1B143S/), CRC Press, 2018.

There is a nominal fee for this event to help cover some of the costs, such as lunch. However, there is a limited number of tickets for those that the cost of the event will create a hardship. To apply for one of these tickets please reach out to John@JPPeach.com with a brief statement of your situation.
